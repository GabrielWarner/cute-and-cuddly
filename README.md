# project-one

A simple page that links to third party API and provides pictures and a bit of information related to the searchable breed of various cats and dogs for user referance. Individual pages for dog search and cat search. and additioanl page with a game for users to choose which animal they think is cuter.


On the Compare page there were multiple processes used, involving connecting to both API's and allowing for some error catching on certain selections in each object array as some would return null data. After importing the images into each column respectfully we used on click function to make the functionality of the game work.

While clicking on either image, using local storage we created an object housing both a statement and respecting value to help create a score sheet. Each tine clicking on the respectful button incrementing the value for dog or cat alike.

The score sheet is a modal that appears on screen and the outside area is the clickable selection so you can exit. The clear button on the screen does use an alert only to give warning for absolute clearing of the data, otherwise it wasn't a necessary component.
